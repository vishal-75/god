        <hr>
        <p>Embedded system and SOC (system on chip) designers choose particular microprocessor cores, libraries, and different tools to develop microprocessor based applications. An ARM processor is one of the best alternatives obtainable for embedded system designers. In the past few years, the ARM architecture has become very popular and these are available from different IC manufacturers. The applications of ARM processors involves in mobile phones, automotive braking systems, etc. A global ARM community partners have developed semiconductor as well as product-design corporations includes an employs like engineers, designers, & developers. This article is about ARM7 based LPC2148 microcontroller, architecture and pin configuration. This article will assist you to understand the basics of the microcontroller.</p>
        <p>The full form of an ARM is an advanced reduced instruction set computer (RISC) machine, and it is a 32-bit processor architecture expanded by ARM holdings. The applications of an ARM processor include several microcontrollers as well as processors. The architecture of an ARM processor was licensed by many corporations for designing ARM processor-based SoC products and CPUs. This allows the corporations to manufacture their products using ARM architecture. Likewise, all main semiconductor companies will make ARM-based SOCs such as Samsung, Atmel, TI etc.</p>
        <p>The LPC2148 microcontroller is designed by Philips (NXP Semiconductor) with several in-built features & peripherals. Due to these reasons, it will make more reliable as well as the efficient option for an application developer. LPC2148 is a 16-bit or 32-bit microcontroller based on ARM7 family.</p>
        <h4>Features of LPC2148</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The LPC2148 is a 16 bit or 32 bit ARM7 family based microcontroller and available in a small LQFP64 package.</li>
            <li>Only 10 bit DAC offers changeable analog o/p.</li>
            <li>External event counter/32 bit timers-2, PWM unit, & watchdog.</li>
            <li>Low power RTC (real time clock) & 32 kHz clock input.</li>
            
        </ul>
